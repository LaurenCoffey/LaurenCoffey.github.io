        <h1> My Erasmus to Cardiff Wales</h1>
        <div class="container"> 
        <h2>Why Cardiff?</h2>
        <p>As part of my 3rd year doing the B.A. degree in Mary Immaculate College, we had the choice to do an off-campus placement or study in another university abroad. I decided to study in a university abroad as I wanted to become more independent, meet new people and experience a different country. 
            
       Sheila my friend and I both wanted to get Media experience as we had a great interest in making and editing videos. Our placement office recommended the University of South Wales, Atrium Campus in Cardiff because it had great Media production Facilities! Both of us applied and got accepted! We spent both semesters September 2017- May 2018 in Wales. </p>

   <h2>University of South Wales</h2>
   
<p> 
    
<li> 
The placement office was certainly right about the media production facilities, it was absolutely fantastic with so much more variety then I was used of! They had a fully equipped TV studio, 2 massive computer labs with Macs and all the editing adobe software you could possibly want. 
</li>
<li>    
You could also rent any cameras, lighting or sound equipment that you wanted from their rental store. Mac laptops with Adobe installed could also be rented and brought home back to your student accommodation to work in your own time, and on your own projects if you wished. This is a brilliant facility as a lot of students cannot afford their own laptops or install this expensive software. 
</li>
<li> 
Lecturers and Students went on socials together, they organized quizzes, bowling nights etc. together and it allowed the students to become closer to each other and closer to their lecturers. I feel this creates a really close dynamic which should be replicated in universities in Ireland.
</li> 
<li> 
I gained so much Media production experience while I was there, making multiple music videos, and a short film! I even got the opportunity to work at the Britainâ€™s Got Talent Auditions.
</li>

<h2>Cons of Living in Cardiff </h2>

<p> 
<li>
I personally think there is a big rubbish problem and the city is slightly dirty. Bags of rubbish are left out on the streets for collection, a lot of them not in bins so often the seagulls get at them and there is always rubbish spilled out on all the streets. Here in Ireland I feel like our rubbish and recycling system it a lot better.
</li>  
<li>
Unfortunately, there is a Homelessness crisis in Cardiff, there is people sleeping on the streets all over the city and it is difficult to see every day.
</li>
<li>
However, in saying that there are very little cons to living in Cardiff.
</li>
</p>

<h2>Pros of Living in Cardiff</h2>

<p>
<li>
Most of the city is pedestrianized, joining together so it is so handy for students to get around!
</li>
<li>
Cardiff is the home of the Principality Stadium. Six nation Rugby matches take place here and it creates a great buzz around the city. I actually got a part time job in the stadium and it is safe to say it was mental! 
</li>
<li>
The city is full of restaurants. You will actually have way too much choice, that fits all dietary requirements. 
</li>
<li>
There is a massive shopping centre in the middle of the city for all your shopping needs.
</li>	 
<li>
It is a very student orientated city, there is always something to do. The number of bars and clubs is endless there is something for everyone! As well as cheap cinema entry for students as little as 3 pounds.
</li>
<li>
I found the UK a lot cheaper than Ireland when I was there, even with the euro/pound conversion.
</li>
 <li>
Even though you are in the middle of a city, nature is so close. There is a massive park in the middle of the city called Bute Park. You can get the bus or a 20minute train to Penarth pier or Barry Island Beach as well as Pen Y fan hill hike. 
 </li>

<p>
    Overall, going on Erasmus was a life changing experience for me! Even though It was lonely and difficult at times, it was all worth it. I would recommend going with a friend because Sheila and I helped each other so much. But if that is not possible do not be afraid to go by yourself. You can do it! Go to social events organized by the Erasmus Society, you will meet other students in the same boat as you! And talk to people in your class, it will take time but do not ever doubt yourself as a person. Erasmus allowed me to become more independent, learn new skills and discover more of who I am as a person. As well as making loads of new friends from all over Europe! I have memories and skills for life!
